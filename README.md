## How to use Search
I used Movie Search API from (https://www.omdbapi.com/)

OMDb API: http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=ba51d8db

I made 3 criteria for searching [Search by `Movie Title`, `Realease Year`, `Movie Type`].
but the API I used may will limit while fetching.

For example, if you want to searh only for the Movie name you can search directly by type [`Harry potter`] on `Movie Title`. 
But to search for Release Year and Movie Type you have to type on `Movie Title` first [`Harry potter`], then 
type on `Realease Year` [`2007`] and `Movie Type` [`Game`] and go back to delete on a `Movie Title` a little bit such like [`Harry potte`]
it will show up the result.
